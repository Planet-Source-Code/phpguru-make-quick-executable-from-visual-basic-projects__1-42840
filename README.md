## Make quick executable from visual basic projects


</div>

### Description

This code will make an executable file from your visual basic project (vbp file) without having to go to Visual Basic and select Make exe.

It's a part of a bigger program i am working on, program that i will post here on psc as long as i will finish. The reason why i'm submitting this code it's to demonstrate the capabilities of shellexecute and the /make switch of visual basic.
 
### More Info
 
The visual basic project (vbp) file

It's assumed that the visual basic program is in C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VB98\vb6.exe . If your visual basic is in different directory, just change the code and put your vb path. Sorry about that, but i am still a beginner and can't find how to get the vb directory from code. If you know i will apreciate some feedback.
